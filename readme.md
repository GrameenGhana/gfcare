# Spark-based Laravel installation

Since `laravel/spark` is not free anymore and cannot be installed or updated with `composer`, you can use this basic
installation of Laravel 5.2 with all Spark code integrated in it.

## Releases

The version numbering follows [Laravel releases](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/releases).

## License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
